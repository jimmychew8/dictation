# dictation
This is a work in progress, and I'm not sure how useful it would be. But real quickly, you can tap in a rhythm and the program will dictate it.
Input the bpms, minimum subdivision of the bpm, and the beats per bar that you want the rhythms to be quantized to. Some things that are going into the mix are tapping metronome that plays while you dictate rhythms, and a few other things.

# Requirements: 
python 2.7
